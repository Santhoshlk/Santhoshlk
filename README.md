## 🚀 About Me  
I’m deeply passionate about **gameplay systems**, **animation architecture**, and **high-end combat design** using Unreal Engine 5.  
My long-term ambition is to become a **Gameplay/Combat Programmer** capable of building full systems like:

- Gameplay Ability System (GAS)  
- ALS-style locomotion  
- AAA combat frameworks  
- Boss AI with behavior trees & EQS  
- High-quality camera systems  
- Modular weapon systems  
- VFX-heavy action mechanics  

I’m also learning **Machine Learning** to combine ML + Unreal for future experimental projects.
